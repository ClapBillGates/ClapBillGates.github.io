    <h1> MOO EMPIRE </h1>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="column column-one"> <strong> First Conference Fall 2021 </strong>
            <br>
            <br>
        After the Great 2021 Power Expansion, rulers VANDOS and VECTOR convened on September 8th, 2021 to discuss governmental matters while on course to preach to the public of Midwood Prison
            <br>
            <br>
        After inducting several prospectus members to the Empire, rulers VECTOR and VANDOS took the liberty to travel and expand horizon. 
            <br>
            <br>
        Till the end of 2021, places such as Rockefeller Plaza, Central and Prospect Park, Sheepshead Bay, etc. had the honor of treating the rulers. 
        </div>
        <div class="column column-two"> <strong> The Genesis </strong> 
            <br>
            <br>
        During early 2020 COVID, Ruler Vandos HippoShine Loveshine23 and Secretary Wapo The Woose established POO!
            <br>
            <br>
        Extension to MOO, FOO, WAZOO, BOO, etc. was, inevitably, added.
            </div>
        <div class="column column-three"> <strong> MOO Golden Age </strong>
            <br>
            <br>
        As part of these conquests, there was a vast effort provided by Ruler VANDOS to physically and mentally empower the members of the Empire. 
            <br>
            <br>
        Almost daily conferences were held at the Palace of VANDOS to address gainz, studies, and other pursuits.
            <br>
            <br>
        The <em> de facto </em> end of the Golden Age of MOO was due to structural mishaps and other internal issues. 
        </div>
        <div class="column column-four"> <strong> Integration of Diarchy </strong>
            <br>
            <br>
        At the conclusion of the 2020 birth, an aspiring new agent was concurred by the title of Professor Vector
            <br>
            <br>
        Due to exceeding dedication to the cause of MOO, Professor Vector was taken into consideration for the grand despot title of <strong> Coruler </strong>
            <br>
            <br>
        In early September of 2021, his Majesty VANDOS HIPPOSHINE inaugurated a diarchy to the title of: <em> Coruler Nicholas Vector BISON TA of all the Commonwealth and Beatitude</em>
        </div>
        <div class="column column-five"> <strong>The Fall of MOO and Rebirth of UHHH </strong>
            <br>
            <br>
        The exit from the Golden Age of MOO was filled with bitterness and boredom.
            <br>
            <br>
        As the NYC school system failed not to make children robotic and monotonous, the rulers were in dire need of new spirit
            <br>
            <br>
        After the Rebirth of 2022, rulers VANDOS and VECTOR convened on matters once again.
            <br>
            <br>
        Expansion of the Empire was revitalized and multiple efforts to empower benefited. 
            <br>
            <br>
        Till the end of the year, drastic gains in membership and the strengthening of the Empire's core allowed for stability and glimpses towards new peaks.
